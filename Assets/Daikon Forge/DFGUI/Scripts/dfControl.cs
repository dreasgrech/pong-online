/// <summary>
/// <b>Base class for all GUI controls</b>. Provides common functionality, event
/// handling, and properties for all user interface controls.
/// <h3>Control Position and Relative Coordinates</h3>
/// <para>DF-GUI uses a parent-relative coordinate system where the origin (0,0)
/// is at the upper left corner of the parent container, the horizontal axis
/// increases to the right, and the vertical axis increases in the downward direction.</para>
/// <para>For example, a control whose dfControl.RelativePosition value is set to 
/// (10,15) will be located ten pixels to the right and fifteen pixels down from the 
/// upper left corner of its container (or the upper-left corner of the screen if 
/// the control has no parent container).</para>
/// <para>Note that the value of the dfControl.RelativePosition and dfControl.Size
/// properties are assumed to represent pixels.</para>
/// <h3>Control Events</h3>
/// <para>Control events in DF-GUI have been designed so that they can be used 
/// in different ways depending on the needs of your game.</para>
/// <h4>Direct events</h4>
/// <para>Each control exposes a number of .NET events which can be subscribed to 
/// using standard .NET event subscription semantics. For example, a script that 
/// wishes to be notified whenever a dfLabel control named <b>health</b> has its 
/// <b>Text</b> property changed might attach an event handler to the <b>dfLabel.TextChanged</b>
/// event as follows:
/// <pre>
/// using UnityEngine;
/// using System.Collections;
/// using System.Collections.Generic;
/// 
/// public class Scratchpad : MonoBehaviour 
/// {
/// 
/// 	public dfLabel health;
/// 
/// 	public void Start()
/// 	{
/// 		health.TextChanged += new PropertyChangedEventHandler<string>( health_TextChanged );
/// 	}
/// 
/// 	void health_TextChanged( dfControl control, string value )
/// 	{
/// 		Debug.Log( "Health changed" );
/// 	}
/// 
/// }
/// </pre>
/// </para>
/// <h4>Reflection-based events</h4>
/// <para>A script component which is attached to the same GameObject as a control component
/// can also subscribe to events using a reflection-based model which involves creating an
/// appropriately-named method for the desired event which follows a specific pattern.</para>
/// <para>Such methods must be named On{XXX}, where {XXX} represents the name of the desired
/// event. For example, a script wishing to be notified of a Click event occuring would define
/// an event handler method as follows:
/// <pre>
/// public void OnClick( dfControl control, dfMouseEventArgs args )
/// {
/// 	Debug.Log( "My control was clicked" );
/// }
/// </pre></para>
/// <para>In the above example, the method's name indicates that it should be called when the 
/// <b>Click</b> event occurs, and the parameter list matches the MouseEventHandler signature 
/// specified by the <b>Click</b> event.</para>
/// <para>Event handlers specified in this manner also have the option of omitting all parameters.
/// If only the fact that the control was clicked were important, and the parameters are not
/// needed by the script, the above method could alternately be defined as:
/// <pre>
/// public void OnClick()
/// {
/// 	Debug.Log( "My control was clicked" );
/// }
/// </pre></para>
/// <para>Note that either all parameters must be included, or no parameters must be included.
/// It is not possible to only define only a subset of the defined parameters.</para>
/// <h4>Event Bubbling</h4>
/// <para>Many of the events raised by a dfControl instance will "bubble" up the control hierarchy.
/// This means that the event will first be processed by the control that raises the event, then 
/// that control's parent, then the control's parent's parent, and so on all the way up the control
/// hierarchy.</para>
/// <para>Specifically, any event whose method signature includes a dfControlEventArgs parameter
/// (or any subclass of dfControlEventArgs such as dfMouseEventArgs or dfDragEventArgs) will 
/// bubble up the hierarchy.</para>
/// <para>For these events, the original source of the event can be determined by the value of the
/// dfControlEventArgs.Source property. Whether the event has already been handled can be 
/// determined by the value of the dfControlEventArgs.Used property.</para>
/// <h4>Event handlers as coroutines</h4>
/// <para>Your event handlers can also be called as a <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/Coroutines.html" target="_blank">coroutine</a>, 
/// so that when the desired event is raised, your code can perform long-running asynchronous operations.</para>
/// <para>In order to function as a coroutine, your event handler must return an IEnumerator object and use the 
/// <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/412/Documentation/ScriptReference/index.Coroutines_26_Yield.html" target="_blank">yield</a> keyword within the method body, like the following example:</para>
/// <pre>public IEnumerator OnClick( dfControl control, dfMouseEventArgs mouseEvent )
/// {
/// 
/// 	Debug.Log( "OnClick() started" );
/// 
/// 	yield return new WaitForSeconds( 2 );
/// 
/// 	Debug.Log( "OnClick() over" );
/// 
/// }</pre>
